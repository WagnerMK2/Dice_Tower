parts list

UV led's , apparently uv light works reall well and fast. find light wave length available.

maybe run low power led's sonstant and run motion activated high power ones.

flash circuit or constant led's

motion sensing device

analog circuit or arduino to run the circuit.

...you know... you could have the microcontroller running the motion sensor randomly overcharge the glow dice or just random chance to not activate. 
i wonder what else you could do besides maybe run a light up dice tower.
